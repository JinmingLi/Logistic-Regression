# Logistic-Regression

This project includes the code I wrote to solve the logistic regression problems where I was asked to build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university based on the student's exam 1 score and exam 2 score.

I first visualized the data in the plot to see how these data looks like. Next, I computed the cost function and gradient. Instead of taking gradient descent, I used "fminunc" another optimization to find the best learning parameters. Last, I visualized the data again and evaluated the logistic regression. The accuracy of the logistic regression is 89%.
